Subject: Urgent Support: Production Environment Down!

Dear TechCorp Support Team,

Our production environment is currently completely unresponsive! Our users are receiving 500 errors when attempting to access the dashboard.

This started approximately 15 minutes ago. We have checked our internal systems and everything appears to be normal. We suspect there is an issue with the TechCorp API or data layer.

This is a SEV-1 issue. Please investigate and update us immediately.
