Subject: Invitation to Participate in SEC Investigation (Witness)

Dear TechCorp Management,

Our law firm represents the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an ongoing investigation regarding market transparency.

We are reaching out to TechCorp as a potential third-party witness to provide industry-specific context regarding software licensing practices. This is a voluntary request for information at this stage.

A formal subpoena has NOT been issued. We would appreciate a brief call with your legal counsel to discuss this matter.

Regards,
