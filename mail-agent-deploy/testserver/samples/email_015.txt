Subject: Partnership Proposal - Joint Marketing Campaign

Dear TechCorp Sales Team,

I represent MarketBoost Agency, and we've been following TechCorp's impressive growth in the enterprise software market.

We would like to propose a joint marketing partnership:

Proposal Overview:
- Co-branded webinar series (4 sessions)
- Joint case study publication
- Social media cross-promotion
- Lead sharing arrangement

We have successfully partnered with companies like SoftCorp and InnovateTech, generating 500+ qualified leads per quarter.

Would TechCorp be interested in a brief call to discuss this opportunity? I'm available next Tuesday or Wednesday.

Looking forward to your response.
