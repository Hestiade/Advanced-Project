Subject: Sales Inquiry: Enterprise License for 500+ Users

Dear TechCorp Industries Sales Team,

I'm the IT Director at Global Manufacturing Co., and we are currently evaluating solutions to replace our legacy project management software.

We've been impressed by your platform's scalability and would like to request a formal proposal for an enterprise license covering 500+ users.

Specific requirements:
- On-premise deployment option
- AD/LDAP integration
- Custom reporting API
- Dedicated support manager

Are you available for a discovery call later this week?

Regards,
Thomas Miller
IT Director
Global Manufacturing Co.
