Subject: Feature Request: Multi-Factor Authentication for Sub-Accounts

To the TechCorp Product Team,

We have been using your platform for 6 months and it has significantly improved our workflow.

However, from a security standpoint, we noticed that sub-accounts currently only support password-based logins. Our security policy requires MFA for all users accessing our data.

Is MFA for sub-accounts on your roadmap? If so, when do you expect it to be released? This is a critical feature for our continued use of the platform.

Best regards,
Security Manager
