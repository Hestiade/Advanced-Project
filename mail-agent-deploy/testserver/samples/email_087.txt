Subject: Urgent Inquiry: Purchase of Gift Cards for Charity

Dear TechCorp Management,

This is a request from the CEO's office (External Communication). We are organizing a last-minute charity auction for local schools and we need to purchase 10x $100 Amazon gift cards for the event.

Since I am currently in a meeting, could you please purchase these cards and email me the codes? I will reimburse the company immediately once I am back.

This is a high priority. Please act fast.

Best regards,
Office of the CEO (Redirected)
