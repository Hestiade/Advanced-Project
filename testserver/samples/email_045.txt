Subject: Question regarding API Rate Limits for Partner Tier

Attention: TechCorp Sales/Technical Team,

We are currently integrated with TechCorp's "Basic" API tier, but we are reaching our rate limits as our traffic grows.

We would like to discuss upgrading to the "Partner" or "Enterprise" tier. Could you provide a comparison of the rate limits (requests per minute) and the pricing for each tier?

Our current API key is: 4492-AX-8812
