Subject: Inquiry about Bulk Pricing for Refurbished Units

Dear TechCorp Sales Team,

We are a non-profit organization dedicated to providing technology access to underprivileged students.

We are interested in purchasing a bulk lot of refurbished "TechCorp Mini" units if you have any available. Our budget is limited, so we are looking for the best possible wholesale rate for 100 units.

Do you have a special pricing tier for non-profits or educational institutions?

Sincerely,
Maria Garcia
Director
Tech4All Foundation
