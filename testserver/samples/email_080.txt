Subject: Feature Request: Export to PDF for Monthly Analytics

Dear TechCorp Product Team,

We love the new analytics dashboard! It has saved us hours of manual data aggregation.

One feature that would make it even better is a "Direct Export to PDF" button. Currently, we have to take screenshots of the charts to include in our monthly board reports. A clean PDF export with TechCorp branding would look much more professional.

Is this on your development roadmap for 2025?

Best regards,
