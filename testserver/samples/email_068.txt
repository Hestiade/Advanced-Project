Subject: Notice of API Deprecation - Action Required by June 2025

Dear TechCorp Industries Technical Team,

We are writing to inform you that the "v1.2 Search API" will be fully deprecated and retired on June 1, 2025.

Our logs indicate that TechCorp is still making active requests to this endpoint. We strongly recommend migrating to the "v2.x GraphQL API" to avoid service disruption.

Migration documentation is available here: [Link]

Thank you for being a valued partner.
