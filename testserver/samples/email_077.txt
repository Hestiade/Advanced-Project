Subject: Question about Invoice #INC-0012 Billing Discrepancy

Hello TechCorp Billing Support,

I am reviewing our latest invoice (#INC-0012) and I noticed a discrepancy. We were billed for 150 users, but our active user count for January was only 135.

Could you please verify the user count on your end and issue a credit if an error was made?

Thank you,
Accounts Payable
