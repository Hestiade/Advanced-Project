Subject: Dispute Resolution: Refund Claim for Unused Licenses

Dear TechCorp Legal/Finance Team,

We are formally disputing the refusal of our refund claim for the 50 unused "User Licenses" purchased last October.

Per the Sales Agreement (Section 7.2), licenses can be returned for a prorated refund if cancelled within 90 days. Our cancellation request was sent on Day 85, yet we were told no refunds are allowed.

We would like to resolve this matter amicably before escalating it to our legal council.

Regards,
COO
