Subject: Checking in - Any thoughts on the proposal?

Hi Client,

I wanted to circle back on the proposal I sent over last week regarding the software licensing implementation.

Have you had a chance to review it with your team? I know you mentioned that budget approval might take a few days.

We are currently offering a 10% discount for deals signed before the end of the month, so I'd love to get this finalized for you if possible.

Let me know if you have any questions or need me to adjust the scope.

Best,
Sales Rep
