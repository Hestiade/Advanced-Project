Subject: Update to Remote Work Policy

Dear Employees,

We are updating our "Work from Home" policy effective March 1st.

**New Policy:**
- Employees are now required to be in the office at least 3 days a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are "Core Days").
- Mondays and Fridays remain optional remote days.

We believe that in-person collaboration is vital for our culture and innovation.

Exceptions can be granted for medical reasons or specific family circumstances; please discuss with your manager.
