Subject: Resume Submission: DevOps Engineer - Sarah Wood

Dear TechCorp HR Team,

I'm writing to express my interest in the DevOps Engineer opening I saw on LinkedIn.

I have extensive experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS, having managed large-scale deployments for FinTech companies. I'm particularly impressed by TechCorp's commitment to open-source contributions.

My resume is attached for your review. I'd love to discuss how my skills align with your infrastructure goals.

Best regards,
Sarah Wood
