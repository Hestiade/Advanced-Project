Subject: Support Ticket #99231: Mobile App Refresh Issue

Dear TechCorp Support Team,

I'm having trouble with the "Swipe to Refresh" gesture in the latest version of your iOS app (v3.2.1).

About 50% of the time, the refresh spinner appears but the data doesn't actually update. I have to kill the app and restart it to see new entries. This is happening on an iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 17.

Is there a known bug or a workaround for this?

Thanks,
