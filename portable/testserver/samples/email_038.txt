Subject: Maintenance Notice: Database Cluster Upgrade

Dear TechCorp IT Department,

This is a reminder that we will be performing a major version upgrade of our managed database clusters on Sunday, Feb 23rd.

Impact:
- 10 minutes of read-only mode during the primary switchover.
- Possible slight latency increases for 30 minutes following the upgrade.

No action is required from your side, but we suggest monitoring your application performance during this window.

Thank you,
CloudDB Team
