Subject: Complaint: Unresolved Technical Issue - Ticket #8812

Dear TechCorp Customer Support,

I am writing to express my extreme frustration regarding Ticket #8812, which has been open for 3 weeks without a resolution.

We are unable to export our monthly reports, which is a critical function for our billing department. Every time I follow up, I am told it is "with engineering," but I receive no updates.

This level of service is unacceptable given that we are on a "Gold" support plan. I request an immediate escalation of this issue.

Sincerely,
Robert Thompson
