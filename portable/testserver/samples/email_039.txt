Subject: Hardware Support: Laptop Replacement Request

To Whom It May Concern at TechCorp Industries,

We are following up on the hardware lifecycle report we sent last month. 

According to our records, 15 of your Dell Precision workstations are now over 4 years old and out of warranty. We suggest replacing these units to ensure employee productivity and hardware reliability.

We can offer a trade-in credit of $100 per unit if you upgrade to the new Latitude series this month.

Please let us know if you would like a formal quote for the refresh.

Sincerely,
Enterprise Sales
