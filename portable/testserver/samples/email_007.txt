Subject: Refund Request - Order #88291

Dear TechCorp Customer Support,

I received my order #88291 yesterday, but the product arrived damaged. The screen has a visible crack that was not present in the product photos.

I would like to request a full refund. I do not want an exchange as I have already purchased a similar item elsewhere.

I have attached photos of the damage. Please send me a return shipping label.

Order Details:
- Order Number: 88291
- Product: Model X Headphones
- Purchase Date: January 15, 2025
- Amount: $299.00

Please process this refund promptly.

Thank you,
Karen Miller
