Subject: Partnership Opportunity - Joint Marketing Campaign

Dear TechCorp Management,

I'm Jessica from MarketBoost Agency. We specialize in co-marketing campaigns for B2B SaaS companies.

After reviewing TechCorp's recent product launch, we believe there's a strong opportunity for a joint webinar or whitepaper focusing on "The Future of AI in Manufacturing".

We reached 20k+ targeted leads in our last campaign with a similar partner. Would your marketing or sales lead be interested in a 15-minute introductory call?

Best regards,
Jessica Chen
