Subject: Instructions for New VPN Client

Hi Users,

We are migrating to a new VPN client (Cisco AnyConnect) effective immediately. The old OpenVPN client will stop working on Friday.

**Instructions:**
1. Go to `vpn.company.com` in your browser.
2. Login with your AD credentials.
3. Download the installer for your OS (Windows/Mac).
4. Run the installer and enter the server address: `vpn.company.com`.

If you have any issues connecting, please open a ticket.
