Subject: Inheritance Notification: Estate of Mr. David TechCorp

DEAR BENEFICIARY,

I am Dr. Williams, a legal representative for the late Mr. David TechCorp, who passed away in a tragic accident last year leaving behind a fortune of $15.5 Million USD.

As you share the same last name and potential lineage, I am reaching out to you to act as the next of kin to claim these funds. We will split the inheritance 50/50.

No risk involved. All I need is your cooperation and absolute confidentiality.

Reply with your full name and phone number to begin the legal process.

Dr. Harrison Williams, Esq.
