Subject: Cease and Desist Notice - Trademark Infringement

Dear TechCorp Legal Department,

We represent OmniCorp, the registered owner of the trademark "SuperWidget" (Reg. No. 555221).

It has come to our attention that TechCorp is using a confusingly similar mark, "Super-Widget," on your website. This constitutes trademark infringement under the Lanham Act.

We hereby demand that you:
1. Immediately cease use of the infringing mark
2. Remove all marketing materials bearing the mark
3. Provide written confirmation of compliance within 10 days

Failure to comply will result in legal action.

Regards,
Robert Chen, Esq.
