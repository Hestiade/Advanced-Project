Subject: Inquiry about Data Privacy for Healthcare Clients

To Whom It May Concern at TechCorp Industries,

Our medical clinic is considering adopting TechCorp's data storage solution. 

However, we need to ensure that the platform is fully HIPAA compliant and that all data at rest and in transit is encrypted using AES-256 or better.

Do you provide a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)? Also, can we request a copy of your latest third-party security audit?

Thank you,
Dr. Robert Lee
