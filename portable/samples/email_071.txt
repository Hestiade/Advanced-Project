Subject: New Lead: Bulk Inquiry for Q3 2025

Dear TechCorp Sales Team,

I represent Global Supply Chainers, and we are interested in transitioning our entire logistics infrastructure to TechCorp's fleet management software.

Estimate of services required:
- 2,000 active vehicle licenses
- Real-time GPS tracking integration
- Custom reporting for fuel efficiency

We would like to request a formal quote and a product demonstration for our leadership team. We are looking to finalize a vendor by May.

Best regards,
Marcus Thorne
Director of Operations
