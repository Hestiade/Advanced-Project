Subject: Request for Temporary Account Reactivation

Dear TechCorp Customer Service,

Our subscription expired yesterday (Account: #881-A), but we missed the renewal notification due to our billing manager being on leave.

Could you please temporarily reactivate our account for 48 hours so we can export our critical data? We intend to renew the subscription once the billing manager returns on Monday.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best,
The Operations Team
