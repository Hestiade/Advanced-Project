Subject: Feedback on the New Mobile App Dashboard

Dear TechCorp Product Team,

Just wanted to send a quick note to say that the new mobile app dashboard is fantastic! The UI is much more intuitive than the previous version.

One small suggestion: the contrast on the secondary text (timestamps) is a bit low for outdoor use. Darkening that text by 20% would make it much easier to read in bright light.

Keep up the great work!

Cheers,
